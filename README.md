# RecZoo :panda_face:
RecZoo is a collection of deep learning applications in recommendation algorithms. 
It mainly collects the mainstream recommendation models and our team's research results in recommendation systems.
The framework uses pytorch.

## Get Started :snail:
1. You have to install and configure the following environment: (My environment)
- Python >= 3.8
- Pytorch = 1.9.0
- Pandas = 1.4.4
- Numpy = 1.23.2
- tqdm = 4.51.0

2. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HeyWeCome/RecZoo.git
```

3. cd into 'src'
```bash
cd RecZoo/src
```

4. Run your or build-in dataset
```bash
python main.py --model_name BPRMF --emb_size 64 --lr 1e-3 --l2 1e-6 --dataset Food
```
